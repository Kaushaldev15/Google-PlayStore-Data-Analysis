<h2>• Steps Involved</h2>
<p>
      <h3>Data Cleaning</h3><br>
      <h3>Data Transforming</h3><br>
      <h3>Natural Langugage Processing</h3><br>
      • This project performs sentiment analysis on Google Play Store reviews using NLP and TextBlob. <br>
      • The analysis is based on three metrics: polarity, subjectivity, and sentiment.<br>
      • The polarity column indicates the sentiment of each review as positive, negative, or neutral.<br>
      • The subjectivity column measures the degree of personal opinion in the review on a scale of 0 to 1, where 0 represents a factual statement and 1 represents a highly opinionated statement.<br>
      • The sentiment column is an aggregate score between -1 and 1 that takes into account both polarity and subjectivity.<br>
      • A score of -1 indicates an extremely negative review, 1 indicates an extremely positive review, and 0 indicates a neutral review.<br>
      • These insights can be useful for improving product quality and customer satisfaction.<br>
